# 100 days of code

100 days of code is a coding challenge in which i did coding problems for 100 days continuously

This challenge started on January 1 and continued till April 100.

Language used - Java




## Roadmap
This is the basic Roadmap i applied while selecting topics and questions

- Pattern Printing Questions.

- Arrays and String 

- Binary search and sorting Algorithm.

- Hashmap, Hashset, Heap.

- Sliding window, two pointers Algorithm.

- Recursion.

- Backtracking

- LinkedList.

- Stacks and Queues.

- Trees.

Starting from Basics and ending up solving medium to hard level questions, 100 days of code is a better way to enhance the problem solving skill.



Here is the total number of contribution along with the contribution chart.
